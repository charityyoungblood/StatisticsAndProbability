<!-- Learning Objectives: Relate measures of center AND spread to the shape of the distribution, and choose the appropriate measures in different contexts --> 

1. Range:
  - The "Range" is EXACTLY the distance between the smallest data point (Min) and the largest one (Max)
      Formula: Range = Max - Min 
  - It is the most intuitive measure of variability
