<!-- Examining Relationships Between Two Variables --> 

1. While it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies typically require exploring the relationship between TWO variables 

2. In most studies involving two variables, each of the variables has a role:
  - The "Explanatory Variable", also referred to as the "Independent Variable" 
    - This is the variable that claims to explain, predict, or affect the response 
    - The "Explanatory Variable" is denoted by "X" 
  - The "Response Variable", also referred to as the "Dependent Variable" 
    - This is the outcome of the study 
    - The "Response Variable" is denoted by "Y"
  
3. Example of Two Variable Relationships 
  - Question: Are test scores affected by the test taker's gender? 
    Explanatory Variable: Gender 
    Response Variable: Test Scores 
    
4. When examining relationships, we further classify each of the TWO RELEVANT VARIABLES according to TYPE:

## There are 4 possibilities of "Role-Type Classification" ##
  
  1. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable 
       
  2. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable
       
  3. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Numeric Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable
       
  4. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as: 
       Numeric Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable 
       
## Side-By-Side Boxplot (C -> Q) ### 

  1. To examine the relationship between two variables where the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is CATEGORICAL and the RESPONSE VARIABLE is QUANTITATIVE we use "Side-By-Side Boxplots" 
  2. The "Side-By-Side" Boxplots allow us to compare the distribution of calorie counts within each category of the Explanatory variable 
  
    ## EXAMPLE OF INTERPRETING THE BOXPLOT DISPLAYS ## 

      Based upon the side-by-side boxplots, the distribution of ages and hours per week of computer use appears the same in each of the three treatment groups. Similarly, the table of conditional percents suggests that the distribution of the genders is about the same in all three treatment groups.
       
    ## EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SUMMARIZE FINDINGS FOR RANDOMIZATION ## 
    
      Our results suggest that the distributions of age, gender, and hours per week of computer use among the three treatments are about the same; therefore, the randomization was successful in balancing these three potential lurking variables among the three treatment groups. We can be fairly sure that any difference between the treatment groups that we find on the user tests of the software will be due to differences in the three software versions, rather than the lurking variables of age, gender, and hours per week of computer use.
      
## Two-Way Table (C -> C) ### 

  1. To summarize the relationship between TWO CATEGORICAL VARIABLES, we create a "Two-Way Table"
      - This looks similar to a frequency table or Excel worksheet 
  
  2. When using a Two-Way table, don't compare the EXACT count, UNLESS the obervations are even between both groups (i.e. if you have a sample of 560 females and 780 males)
    - In this case, we would use a numerical summary 
    - This can be done by converting the counts to percentages within each value of the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE separately; These percentages are called "Conditional Percentages" - since we find them by "conditioning" one of the variables 
    
  3. Conditional Percentages: 
    - Conditional Percentages are calculated for each value of the explanatory variable separately 
    - If the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is in a ROW (Horizontal) the Conditional Percentage is calculated by ROW 
    - If the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is in a COLUMN (Vertical) the Conditional Percentage is calculated by COLUMN (vertical)
    
  4. Categorical Explanatory Variable AND Categorical Response Variable 
    - When examining the relationship between TWO Categorical Variables, you compare the distributions of the Response variable for values of the Explanatory Variable 
    - We look at how the pattern of conditional percentages differs between the values of the Explanatory Variable 
    
## Linear Relationships (Q -> Q) ## 

  1. Relationships that have "Linear" form are quite common and relatively simple to detect 
  2. There exists a numerical measure that assesses the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables with which we can supplement the Scatterplot 
  3. REMEMBER: NOT all relationships between two quantitative variables has a Linear form 
  4. Assessing the "Strength" of a Linear Relationship from a Scatterplot alone is problematic, as our judgement might be affected by the scale on which the values are plotted 
  5. To CORRECTLY assess the strength of a Linear Relationship - we use the "Correlation Coefficient" 
    - CORRELATION COEFFICIENT: denoted by "r", this is a numerical measure that measures the STRENGTH and DIRECTION of a Linear Relationship between two QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES
    - The value of "r" ranges from -1 to 1, "r" CANNOT take values outside of this range 
    - The sign of "r" either positive or negative, indicates the DIRECTION of the Relationship 
    - Negative values of "r" indicate a "Negative Relationship" 
    - Positive values of "r" indicate a "Positive Relationship" 
    - "r" indicates the "Strength" of the Linear Relationship 
    - Values of "r" that are CLOSER TO ZERO, positive or negative, indicate a WEAK LINEAR RELATIONSHIP 
      - The closer "r" is to zero, the WEAKER the relationship 
      - If "r" is EQUAL TO zero, which is extremely rare, this indicates NO LINEAR RELATIONSHIP 
    - Values of "r" close to -1 indicate a Strong NEGATIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP; the CLOSER "r" is to -1, the STRONGER the relationship
    - Values of "r" close to 1 indicate a Strong POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP; the CLOSER "r" is to 1, the STRONGER the relationship
    - The CORRELATION COEFFICIENT can ONLY be interpreted as the measure of Strength of a Linear Relationship - we need the Scatterplot to VERIFY that the relationship indeed looks Linear 
    
## Extrapolation: is the prediction of values of the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE that fall outside the range of the data - Extrapolation SHOULD BE AVOIDED ### 
  
  Examples of Summarizing your findings:  
  
  Data Analysis Question: Is there a relationship between students' college GPAs and their high school GPAs?
  
    Instructions: Write a short summary report of the main findings that you discovered using the data. For your convenience, your individual conclusions are provided below. You may edit them to create your summary.
  
    Answer: In the first and third question, we examined two explanatory variables for the response variable college GPA. We found that generally, students who have a high high school GPA will tend to also have a high college GPA, and that students who typically sit in the front of the classroom generally have a higher GPA than those who sit in the middle or the back. In the second question, we investigated a completely unrelated issue, the differences in body image between males and females. We were surprised to find that actually a higher percentage of females were satisfied with their weight than males.
