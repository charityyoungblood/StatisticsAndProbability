<!-- Examining Relationships Between Two Variables --> 

1. While it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies typically require exploring the relationship between TWO variables 

2. In most studies involving two variables, each of the variables has a role:
  - The "Explanatory Variable", also referred to as the "Independent Variable" 
    - This is the variable that claims to explain, predict, or affect the response 
    - The "Explanatory Variable" is denoted by "X" 
  - The "Response Variable", also referred to as the "Dependent Variable" 
    - This is the outcome of the study 
    - The "Response Variable" is denoted by "Y"
  
3. Example of Two Variable Relationships 
  - Question: Are test scores affected by the test taker's gender? 
    Explanatory Variable: Gender 
    Response Variable: Test Scores 
    
4. When examining relattionships, we further classify each of the TWO RELEVANT VARIABLES according to TYPE:

## There are 4 possibilities of "Role-Type Classification" ##
  
  1. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable 
       
  2. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable
       
  3. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Numeric Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable
       
  4. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as: 
       Numerics Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable 
       
## Side-By-Side Boxplot (C -> Q) ### 

  1. To examine the relationship between two variables where the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is CATEGORICAL and the RESPONSE VARIABLE is QUANTITATIVE we use "Side-By-Side Boxplots" 
  2. The "Side-By-Side" Boxplots allow us to compare the distribution of calorie counts within each category of the Explanatory variable 
       
## Two-Way Table (C -> C) ### 

  1. To summarize the relationship between two categorical variables, we create a "Two-Way Table"
      - This looks similar to a frequency table or Excel worksheet 
  
  2. When using a Two-Way table, don't compare the EXACT count, UNLESS the obervations are even between both groups (i.e. if you have a sample of 560 females and 780 males)
    - In this case, we would use a numerical summary 
    - This can be done by converting the counts to percentages within each value of the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE separately; These percentages are called "Conditional Percentages" - since we find them by "conditioning" one of the variables 
    
  3. Conditional Percentages: 
    - Conditional Percentages are calculated for each value of the explanatory variable separately 
    - If the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is in a ROW (Horizontal) the Conditional Percentage is calculated by ROW 
    - If the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is in a COLUMN (Vertical) the Conditional Percentage is calculated by COLUMN (vertical)
    
  4. Categorical Explanatory Variable AND Categorical Response Variable 
    - When examining the relationship between TWO Categorical Variables, you compare the distributions of the Response variable for values of the Explanatory Variable 
    - We look at how the pattern of conditional percentages differs between the values of the Explanatory Variable 
    
## Linear Relationships (Q -> Q) ## 

  1. Relationships that have "Linear" form are quite common and relatively simple to detect 
  2. There exists a numerical measure that assesses the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables with which we can supplement the Scatterplot 
  3. REMEMBER: NOT all relationships between two quantitative variables has a Linear form
