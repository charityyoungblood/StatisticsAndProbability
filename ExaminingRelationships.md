<!-- Examining Relationships Between Two Variables --> 

1. While it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies typically require exploring the relationship between TWO variables 

2. In most studies involving two variables, each of the variables has a role:
  - The "Explanatory Variable", also referred to as the "Independent Variable" 
    - This is the variable that claims to explain, predict, or affect the response 
    - The "Explanatory Variable" is denoted by "X" 
  - The "Response Variable", also referred to as the "Dependent Variable" 
    - This is the outcome of the study 
    - The "Response Variable" is denoted by "Y"
  
3. Example of Two Variable Relationships 
  - Question: Are test scores affected by the test taker's gender? 
    Explanatory Variable: Gender 
    Response Variable: Test Scores 
    
4. When examining relattionships, we further classify each of the TWO RELEVANT VARIABLES according to TYPE:

## There are 4 possibilities of "Role-Type Classification" ##
  
  1. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable 
       
  2. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable
       
  3. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Numeric Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable
       
  4. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as: 
       Numerics Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable
