<!-- Examining Relationships Between Two Variables --> 

1. While it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies typically require exploring the relationship between TWO variables 

2. In most studies involving two variables, each of the variables has a role:
  - The "Explanatory Variable", also referred to as the "Independent Variable" 
    - This is the variable that claims to explain, predict, or affect the response 
    - The "Explanatory Variable" is denoted by "X" 
  - The "Response Variable", also referred to as the "Dependent Variable" 
    - This is the outcome of the study 
    - The "Response Variable" is denoted by "Y"
  
3. Example of Two Variable Relationships 
  - Question: Are test scores affected by the test taker's gender? 
    Explanatory Variable: Gender 
    Response Variable: Test Scores 
    
4. When examining relattionships, we further classify each of the TWO RELEVANT VARIABLES according to TYPE:

## There are 4 possibilities of "Role-Type Classification" ##
  
  1. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable 
       
  2. Categorical Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Qualitative Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable
       
  3. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Quantitative Response Variable, which is the same as:
       Numeric Independent Variable and Numeric Dependent Variable
       
  4. Quantitative Explanatory Variable and Categorical Response Variable, which is the same as: 
       Numerics Independent Variable and Qualitative Dependent Variable 
       
## Side-By-Side Boxplot (C -> Q) ### 

  1. To examine the relationship between two variables where the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is CATEGORICAL and the RESPONSE VARIABLE is QUANTITATIVE we use "Side-By-Side Boxplots" 
  2. The "Side-By-Side" Boxplots allow us to compare the distribution of calorie counts within each category of the Explanatory variable 
       
## Two-Way Table (C -> C) ### 

  1. To summarize the relationship between two categorical variables, we create a "Two-Way Table"
      - This looks similar to a frequency table or Excel worksheet 
  
  2. When using a Two-Way table, don't compare the EXACT count, UNLESS the obervations are even between both groups (i.e. if you have a sample of 560 females and 780 males)
    - In this case, we would use a numerical summary 
    - This can be done by converting the counts to percentages within each value of the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE separately; These percentages are called "Conditional Percentages" - since we find them by "conditioning" one of the variables 
    
  3. Conditional Percentages: 
    - Conditional Percentages are calculated for each value of the explanatory variable separately 
    - If the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is in a ROW (Horizontal) the Conditional Percentage is calculated by ROW 
    - If the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE is in a COLUMN (Vertical) the Conditional Percentage is calculated by COLUMN (vertical)
    
  4. Categorical Explanatory Variable AND Categorical Response Variable 
    - When examining the relationship between TWO Categorical Variables, you compare the distributions of the Response variable for values of the Explanatory Variable 
    - We look at how the pattern of conditional percentages differs between the values of the Explanatory Variable 
    
## Linear Relationships (Q -> Q) ## 

  1. Relationships that have "Linear" form are quite common and relatively simple to detect 
  2. There exists a numerical measure that assesses the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables with which we can supplement the Scatterplot 
  3. REMEMBER: NOT all relationships between two quantitative variables has a Linear form 
  4. Assessing the "Strength" of a Linear Relationship from a Scatterplot alone is problematic, as our judgement might be affected by the scale on which the values are plotted 
  5. To CORRECTLY assess the strength of a Linear Relationship - we use the "Correlation Coefficient" 
    - CORRELATION COEFFICIENT: denoted by "r", this is a numerical measure that measures the STRENGTH and DIRECTION of a Linear Relationship between two QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES
    - The value of "r" ranges from -1 to 1, "r" CANNOT take values outside of this range 
    - The sign of "r" either positive or negative, indicates the DIRECTION of the Relationship 
    - Negative values of "r" indicate a "Negative Relationship" 
    - Positive values of "r" indicate a "Positive Relationship" 
    - "r" indicates the "Strength" of the Linear Relationship 
    - Values of "r" that are CLOSER TO ZERO, positive or negative, indicate a WEAK LINEAR RELATIONSHIP 
      - The closer "r" is to zero, the WEAKER the relationship 
      - If "r" is EQUAL TO zero, which is extremely rare, this indicates NO LINEAR RELATIONSHIP 
    - Values of "r" close to -1 indicate a Strong NEGATIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP; the CLOSER "r" is to -1, the STRONGER the relationship
    - Values of "r" close to 1 indicate a Strong POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP; the CLOSER "r" is to 1, the STRONGER the relationship
    - The CORRELATION COEFFICIENT can ONLY be interpreted as the measure of Strength of a Linear Relationship - we need the Scatterplot to VERIFY that the relationship indeed looks Linear
