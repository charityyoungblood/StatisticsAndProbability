<!-- Examining Relationships Between Two Variables --> 

1. While it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies typically require exploring the relationship between TWO variables 

2. In most studies involving two variables, each of the variables has a role:
  - The "Explanatory Variable", also referred to as the "Independent Variable" 
    - This is the variable that claims to explain, predict, or affect the response 
    - The "Explanatory Variable" is denoted by "X" 
  - The "Response Variable", also referred to as the "Dependent Variable" 
    - This is the outcome of the study 
    - The "Response Variable" is denoted by "Y"
  
3. Examples of Two Variable Relationships 
  - Question: Are test scores affected by the test taker's gender? 
    Explanatory Variable: Gender 
    Response Variable: Test Scores
