<!-- Scale of Measurement --> 

## The Scales of Measurement become INCREASINGLY PRECISE, with each level, while maintaining the characteristics of the level below it (i.e. Ordinal data BUILDS on the characteristics of Nominal data)

There are four different scales of measurement from LEAST precise to MOST precise, and are as follows:

1. Nominal: (think of definition of Nominal - "small")
  - this is the LEAST precise measure of data 
  - it only indicates DIFFERENCES 
  - Nominal level data uses DISCRETE CATEGORIES to describe qualitative/categorical data 
  - Examples of Nominal Data: 
        - Types of Shoes - Booties, Sandals, Flats, Pumps, Boots
        - Eye Color 
        - Gender 

2. Ordinal: (think of definition of Ordinal - "a number defining an object's POSITION in a series")
  - MORE precise than Nominal Data, as the difference can be ranked and "ordered"
  - An Ordinal variable is a categorical/qualitative variable for which the possible values are "ordered"
  - Ordinal data does NOT indicate if the DIFFERENCE between two numbers are "fixed" or "equal"
  - Ordinal variables do NOT show the magnitude of difference between two adjacent points 
  - Ordinal variables can be considered "in between" categorical and quantitative variables
  - Examples of Ordinal Data:
        - Education Level 
        - Order of finishes in a race (1st place, 2nd place)

3. Interval: (think of definition of Interval - "a SPACE BETWEEN two objects")
  - Builds upon the characteristics of Ordinal Data through the addition of MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES between two numbers 
  - The distance between pairs of "consecutive" numbers is assumed to be equal 
  - Interval variables do NOT have a meaningful zero point - A "0" does NOT mean the ABSENCE of an attribute, it refers to a particular, but arbitrary point on the scale 
  - Examples of Interval Data:
        - Temperature
        - SAT Scores 

4. Ratio: 
  - this level of data is MOST precise 
  - in Ratio Level, a number is assigned to a subject that represents the AMOUNT of the ATTRIBUTE/CHARACTERISTIC that the subject has and the difference between consecutive numbers is assumed to be equal 
  - it has ALL of the characteristics of Interval Data, plus a meaningful zero point 
  - For ratio measures, the "zero" tells us that the attribute or "variable" is NOT present in the participant/individual
  - The distance between pairs of "consecutive" numbers is assumed to be equal 
  - Examples of Ratio Data:
        - Age - it is possible to have the "absence" of age 
        - Height 
        - Weight 

## IMPORTANT ############################

- It is important to know that MORE PRECISE data can ALWAYS be SCALED DOWN to LESS PRECISE data

  Ex: A Ratio level variable like "Age" can be scaled down into an Ordinal level variable of "Age Groups"
    Ratio Level: Age in years - 3, 20, 15, 85, etc
    Ordinal Level: Age Groups - Toddler, Young Adult, Adolescent, Senior)
    
- LESS PRECISE data CANNOT be made into MORE PRECISE data, i.e. an Ordinal Level variable like Age Groups, CANNOT be changed into a Ratio Level variable like Age in years 

## So, why is it imoprtant to understand Scales of Measurement? ## 

- Statistical methods are ways of SUMMARIZING, ANALYZING, and INTERPRETING data and are designed for SPECIFIC TYPES of data 

- Researchers need to know the LEVEL OF MEASUREMENT of their data when SELECTING a STATISTICAL METHOD, since using an incorrect method for ANALYZING data can affect the reliability and accuracy of the results 

- Keep these levels in mind, whenever you are analyzing data
