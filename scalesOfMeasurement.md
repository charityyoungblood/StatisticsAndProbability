<!-- Scale of Measurement --> 

## The Scales of Measurement become INCREASINGLY PRECISE, with each level, while maintaining the characteristics of the level below it (i.e. Ordinal data BUILDS on the characteristics of Nominal data)

There are four different scales of measurement from LEAST precise to MOST precise, and are as follows:

1. Nominal: 
  - this is the LEAST precise measure of data 
  - it only indicates DIFFERENCES 
  - Nominal level data uses discrete categories to describe qualitative/categorical (data you can operate on) 
  - Examples of Nominal Data: 
        - Types of Shoes - Booties, Sandals, Flats, Pumps, Boots
        - Eye Color 
        - Gender 

2. Ordinal:
  - MORE precise than Nominal Data, as the difference can be ranked and "ordered"
  - An Ordinal variable is a categorical/qualitative variable for which the possible values are "ordered"
  - Ordinal data does NOT indicate if the DIFFERENCE between two numbers are "fixed" or "equal"
  - Ordinal variables do NOT show the magnitude of difference between two adjacent points 
  - Ordinal variables can be considered "in between" categorical and quantitative variables
  - Examples of Ordinal Data:
        - Education Level 
        - Order of finishes in a race (1st place, 2nd place)

3. Interval: 
  - Builds upon the characteristics of Ordinal Data through the addition of meaningful differences between two numbers 
  - The distance between pairs of "consecutive" numbers is assumed to be equal 
  - Interval variables do NOT have a meaningful zero point - A "0" does NOT mean the ABSENCE of an attribute 

4. Ratio:
