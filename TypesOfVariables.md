<!-- Types of Variables --> 

Variables can be of two distinct types: Categorical (Qualitative) and Numeric (Quantitative)

1. Categorical (Qualitative): 
  - Categorical variables describe "quality", or a "characteristic" of a data unit 
  - They answer the question "to what CATEGORY does this record belong and what are it's properties?" 
  - There are two sub-types of Categorical variables 
    - Nominal: these are observations that CANNOT be organized into a logical sequence (i.e. Gender, Eye Color)
    - Ordinal: these are observations that CAN be organized into sequence (i.e. Ranking - 1st, 2nd, 3rd; Clothing Size - Small, Medium, Large) 

2. Numeric (Quantitative)
  - Numeric variables answer the question "how MUCH or how MANY" 
  - There are two sub-types of Numerical variables 
    - Discrete numeric variables: these are whole numbers - CANNOT be a fraction or decimal (i.e. number of people, number of homes)
    - Continuous variables: these CAN be fraction or decimal values (i.e. height, or Age)
