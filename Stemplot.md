<!-- Stemplot --> 

1. The Stemplot (also called stem and leaf plot) is a graphical display of the distribution of quantitative data 
  - The Stemplot data is created by the following: 
    - The "leaf" is the digit in the digit in the "ones" place 
    - The "stem" is everything except the digit in the "ones" place   
      Ex: If the data point is 34 
            Leaf: 4
            Stem: 3
      Ex2: If the data point is 3.41
            Leaf: 1
            Stem: 3.4
            
2. To create a Stemplot 
  - Separate each observation into a "stem" and a "leaf"
  - Write the stems in a vertical column with the smallest at the top, and draw a vertical line at the right of this column
  - Go through the data points, and write each "leaf" in the row to the right of its "stem"
  - Rearrange the "leaves" in an INCREASING order
  ** NOTE: When a stem holds a large number of leaves, we can split each stem into two **
  
3. The Stemplot has additional unique features: 
  - It preserves the original data
  - It sorts the data
  
<!-- Dotplot --> 

The Dotplot shows each observation, but displays it with a dot, rather than its actual value
