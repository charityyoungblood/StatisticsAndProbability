<!-- Interpreting the Histogram --> 

1. Once the Histogram has been displayed graphically, we can describe the overall pattern of the distribution and mention any striking deviations from that pattern 

2. The following are features of the distribution: 
  - Shape  >>>
  - Center >>> Shape, Center and Spread are all part of the OVERALL PATTERN 
  - Spread >>> 
  - Outliers: these are DEVIATIONS from the pattern 
  
3. We will get a sense of the overall pattern of the data from the Histogram's CENTER, SHAPE and SPREAD, while the OUTLIERS will highlight deviations from that pattern 

4. Mode: Any value of a data variable or random variable at which the frequency curve or probability curve reaches a peak is called a mode
  
5. When describing the shape of a distribution, you are looking at the:
  - Symmetry or Skew of the distribution 
  - Modality or Peak - the number of peaks (modes) the distribution has 
  
6. Symmetric Distributions 
  - - Most distributions in practice have one peak and are described as "unimodal" 
  - A distribution with two peaks is called "bimodal"
  - A flat distribution is called "uniform" - this is a distribution that has NO modes or no value(s) where the observations are concentrated
