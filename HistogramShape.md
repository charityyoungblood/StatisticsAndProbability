<!-- Interpreting the Histogram --> 

1. Once the Histogram has been displayed graphically, we can describe the overall pattern of the distribution and mention any striking deviations from that pattern 

2. The following are features of the distribution: 
  - Shape  >>>
  - Center >>> Shape, Center and Spread are all part of the OVERALL PATTERN 
  - Spread >>> 
  - Outliers: these are DEVIATIONS from the pattern 
  
3. We will get a sense of the overall pattern of the data from the Histogram's CENTER, SHAPE and SPREAD, while the OUTLIERS will highlight deviations from that pattern 

4. Mode: Any value of a data variable or random variable at which the frequency curve or probability curve reaches a peak is called a mode
  
5. When describing the shape of a distribution, you are looking at the:
  - Symmetry or Skew of the distribution 
  - Modality or Peak - the number of peaks (modes) the distribution has 
  
6. Symmetric Distributions 
  - - Most distributions in practice have one peak and are described as "unimodal" 
  - A distribution with two peaks is called "bimodal"
  - A flat distribution is called "uniform" - this is a distribution that has NO modes or no value(s) where the observations are concentrated 
  
7. Skewed Right Distributions 
  - In "Skewed Right" distributions the "right tail" or LARGER VALUES is much longer than the left tail (SMALLER VALUES)
  - In this type of shape, the bulk of the observations are "small/medium" with a few observations that are much larger than the rest 
  - An example of a real-life variable that has a "skewed right" distribution is Salary 

8. Skewed Left Distributions 
  - This is a shape where the left tail (SMALLER VALUES) is much longer than the right tail (LARGER VALUES)
  - In a "skewed left" distribution, the bulk of the observations are medium/large, with a few observations that are much smaller than the rest 
  - An example of a real-life variable that has a "skewed left" distribution is age of death from natural causes 
  
9. Exceptions 
  - Skewed distributions can be "bimodal" 
  - If a distribution has more than two modes, we say that distribution is multimodal 
  
10. Center
  - The center of the distribution is it's midpoint, this is the value that divides the distribution so that approximately half of the observations take smaller values and approximately half of the distributions take larger values 
  
11. Spread (also called variability)
  - The "Spread" can be described by the approximate range covered by the data
  - From looking at the Histogram we can approximate the smallest observation (min) and the largest observation (max),
