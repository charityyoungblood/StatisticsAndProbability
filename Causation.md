<!-- Causation and Lurking Variables: Introduction --> 

## Learning Objective: Recognize the distinction between association and causation, and identify potential lurking variables for explaining an observed relationship ###

1. When we explore the relationship between two variables, you might be tempted to interpret the observed association as causation

2. Association DOES NOT imply CAUSATION

3. Lurking Variable: A variable that is NOT among the Explanatory or Response Variables in a study, but could substantially affect your interpretation of the relationship among those variables
