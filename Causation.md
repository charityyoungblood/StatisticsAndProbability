<!-- Causation and Lurking Variables: Introduction --> 

## Learning Objectives: 
 ## - Recognize the distinction between association and causation, and identify potential lurking variables for explaining an observed relationship 
 ## - Recognize and explain the phenomenon of Simpson's paradox as it relates to interpreting the relationship between two variables
 
## ###########

1. When we explore the relationship between two variables, you might be tempted to interpret the observed association as causation

2. Association DOES NOT imply CAUSATION

3. Lurking Variable: A variable that is NOT among the Explanatory or Response Variables in a study, but could substantially change your interpretation of the data if it were included 
  - There are instances where you will need to include or account for the lurking variable in your study
  - Whenever including a Lurking Variable causes us to RETHINK the direction of an association, this is called "Simpson's Paradox" 
  - It is NOT always the case that including a Lurking Variable makes us rethink the direction of the association - in some cases, it just helps us BETTER UNDERSTAND the observed relationship
