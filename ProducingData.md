<!-- Producing Data --> 

- After we have chosen the population for our study, we have to choose the "Sample" 
- Once we have chosen the sample, we can collect the data 



## Steps for Producing Data ## 

Step 1: Sampling 
  - Choose a sample that is truly REPRESENTATIVE of the larger population 
  - The summaries of variables and their relationships are only valid if these have been assessed properly 
  - Biased Sample: A sample that produces data that is NOT representative because of the systematic under-estimation or over-estimation of the variable of interest 
Step 2: Study Design 
  - Studies should be designed to discover what we want to know about the variables of interest for the individuals in the sample 
  - If you want to know if there is a CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP between variables, special care should be given to the design of the study

Sampling: Types of Samples
  
  1. Volunteer Sample
    - Where the individuals that are chosen to participate in the study have SELECTED THEMSELVES to be included 
    - Volunteer samples are almost guaranteed to be BIASED, as the participants are ones that have a strong opinion about an issue and are looking for an opportunity to voice it 
    - In this case, we cannot generalize the findings from a volunteer sample to the larger population
    ## In the case of MEDICAL TREATMENTS - a Volunteer Sample is the only ethical way to obtain information from participants ##
    
  2. Convenience Sample 
    - Where the individuals that are chosen to participate in the study happen to be in "the right place at the right time" to suit the schedule of the researcher 
    - There are subtle reasons why the sample's results are BIASED, as certain types of individuals are more likely to be selected than others
