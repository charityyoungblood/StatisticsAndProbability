<!-- Producing Data --> 

- After we have chosen the population for our study, we have to choose the "Sample" 
- Once we have chosen the sample, we can collect the data 



## Steps for Producing Data ## 

Step 1: Sampling 
  - Choose a sample that is truly REPRESENTATIVE of the larger population 
  - The summaries of variables and their relationships are only valid if these have been assessed properly 
  - Biased Sample: A sample that produces data that is NOT representative because of the systematic under-estimation or over-estimation of the variable of interest 
Step 2: Study Design 
  - Studies should be designed to discover what we want to know about the variables of interest for the individuals in the sample 
  - If you want to know if there is a CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP between variables, special care should be given to the design of the study
