<!-- Producing Data --> 

- After we have chosen the population for our study, we have to choose the "Sample" 
- Once we have chosen the sample, we can collect the data 



## Steps for Producing Data ## 

Step 1: Sampling 
  - Choose a sample that is truly REPRESENTATIVE of the larger population 
  - The summaries of variables and their relationships are only valid if these have been assessed properly 
  - Biased Sample: A sample that produces data that is NOT representative because of the systematic under-estimation or over-estimation of the variable of interest 
Step 2: Study Design 
  - Studies should be designed to discover what we want to know about the variables of interest for the individuals in the sample 
  - If you want to know if there is a CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP between variables, special care should be given to the design of the study

## Sampling: Types of Samples ##
  
  1. Volunteer Sample
    - Where the individuals that are chosen to participate in the study have SELECTED THEMSELVES to be included 
    - Volunteer samples are almost guaranteed to be BIASED, as the participants are ones that have a strong opinion about an issue and are looking for an opportunity to voice it 
    - In this case, we cannot generalize the findings from a volunteer sample to the larger population
    ## In the case of MEDICAL TREATMENTS - a Volunteer Sample is the only ethical way to obtain information from participants ##
    
  2. Convenience Sample 
    - Where the individuals that are chosen to participate in the study happen to be in "the right place at the right time" to suit the schedule of the researcher 
    - There are subtle reasons why the sample's results are BIASED, as certain types of individuals are more likely to be selected than others 

  3. Sampling Frame 
    - A list of potential individuals or items TO BE sampled
    - The "Sampling Frame" needs to match the population of interest as closely as possible, otherwise there can be bias in the study 
    
  4. Systematic Sampling 
    - Where the individuals that are chosen to participate in the study are selected from an "Ordered Sampling Frame"
    - Ex: Obtain a student directory with email addresses of all the university's students, and send the music poll to every 50th name on the list
    - This method of sampling is not subject to any clear bias, but it is not as safe as taking a "Random Sample" 
    
  5. Simple Random Sample
    - Where the individuals that are chosen to participate in the study are chosen COMPLETELY at random, and without replacement 
    - As long as ALL participants respond, then the sample is NOT subject to any BIAS, and should succeed in being representative of the population of interest 
    - If only a fraction of the participants respond to the study questions, you would have potential problems associated with "Volunteer Response" 
    - "Volunteer Respnse" isn't as problematic as a "Volunteer Sample", but there is still the danger that the small amount of participants that did respond (i.e. 40%) are different from those who don't 
    
## Sampling: Probability Sampling Plans ##

  1. "Probability Sampling" is where all the individuals within a given population have equal chances of being selected, i.e. "Random Selection"
  
  2. Simple Random Sampling
    - The simplest probability sampling plan
    - This is equivalent to “selecting names out of a hat”
    - Each individual has the SAME CHANCE of being selected
    
  3. Cluster Sampling 
    - This sampling technique is used when our population is naturally divided into groups - which are called "Clusters" 
    - We take a "Random Sample" of "Clusters" and use ALL the individuals within the selected "Clusters" as our sample 
  
  4. Stratified Sampling 
    - Is used when our population is naturally divided into sub-populations, which we call stratum (plural: strata)
    - We choose a "Simple Random Sample" from each "Stratum" and our sample consists of ALL the "Simple Random Samples" put together 
    
  5. Examples: Cluster Sampling vs Stratiified Sampling 
     
     Analysis Question: Suppose you would like to study the job satisfaction of hospital nurses in a certain city based on a sample. Besides taking a simple random sample, here are two additional ways to obtain such a sample:

        - Suppose that the city has 10 hospitals. Choose one of the 10 hospitals at random and interview ALL the nurses in THAT hospital regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example of "Cluster Sampling", in which THE HOSPITALS are the "Clusters".

        - Choose a random sample of 50 nurses from each of the 10 hospitals and interview these 50 * 10 = 500 regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example of "Stratified Sampling", in which EACH HOSPITAL is a "Stratum".
    
## EACH of the "Probability Sampling Plans", if applied CORRECTLY, are NOT subject to any BIAS, and will produce samples that represent the population well ### 

## Sample Size ## 

  - Our FIRST priority is to make sure the sample is representative of the population, by using some form of probability sampling plan 
  - To get a more precise idea of what values are taken by the variable of interest for the entire population, a larger sample does a better job, than a smaller one
