Types of Study Designs

## The type of design used, and the details of the design, are CRUCIAL, since they will determine what kind of conclusions we may draw from the results. 

  1. Observational Study: 
    - In this study design, values of the variable(s) of interest are recorded as they naturally occur 
    - There is NO interference by the researchers who conduct the study 
    - Within "Observational Study Design" are two subtypes:
      - Prospective: In a "Prospective Observational Study" the variables of interest are recorded in a "future" time
      - Retrospective: In a "Retrospective Observational Study" the variables of interest are recorded in a "past" time 
  2. Sample Survey 
    - A type of "Observational Study" where individuals report variables values themselves, frequently by giving their opinions 
  
  3. Experiment
    - In this study design, the researchers interfere, and they are the ones to assign the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals 
    - The researchers "take control" of the values of the explanatory variable because they want to see how changes in the value of the explanatory variable affect the response variable
