Types of Study Designs

## The type of design used, and the details of the design, are CRUCIAL, since they will determine what kind of conclusions we may draw from the results. 

  1. Observational Study: 
    - In this study design, values of the variable(s) of interest are recorded as they naturally occur 
    - There is NO interference by the researchers who conduct the study 
    - Within "Observational Study Design" are two subtypes:
      - Prospective: In a "Prospective Observational Study" the variables of interest are recorded in a "future" time
      - Retrospective: In a "Retrospective Observational Study" the variables of interest are recorded in a "past" time 
      
  2. Sample Survey 
    - A type of "Observational Study" where individuals report variables values themselves, frequently by giving their opinions 
  
  3. Experiment
    - In this study design, the researchers interfere, and they are the ones to assign the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals 
    - The researchers "take control" of the values of the explanatory variable because they want to see how changes in the value of the explanatory variable affect the response variable

Causation and Observational Studies 

  1. Because of the existence of a virtually UNLIMITED number of potential LURKING VARIABLES that we can never be 100% certain of a claim of causation based on an observational study
  
  2. If great care is taken to CONTROL for the MOST LIKELY LURKING VARIABLES (and to avoid other pitfalls which we will discuss presently), and if common sense indicates that there is good reason for one variable to cause changes in the other, then researchers may assert that an observational study provides good evidence of causation
  
  3. We have a MUCH better chance of accomplishing the goal of establishing causation by carrying out a WELL-DESIGNED EXPERIMENT

Sample Surveys: Design Issues

  1. Open vs. Closed Questions
    - Open questions are less restrictive, but responses are more difficult to summarize.
    - Closed questions may be biased by the options provided
    - Closed questions should permit options such as "other:______" and/or "not sure" if those options may apply
    
  2. Unbalanced Response Options
    
  3. Leading Questions
    - Earlier questions should not deliberately influence responses to later questions
    
  4. Planting Ideas With Questions
    - Questions should be worded neutrally

  5. Complicated Questions
    - Questions shouldn't be confusing or complicated
    
  6. Sensitive Questions
    - Survey method and questions should be carefully designed to elicit honest responses if there are sensitive issues involved
  
- Effective techniques for collecting accurate data on "sensitive questions" are a main inquiry in Statistics 
- One simple method is "Randomized Response" - which allows individuals in the sample to answer anonymously, while the researcher still gains information about the population 
- Tactful wording of questions is also a helpful method for sensitive questions
