<!-- Study Design Introduction --> 

Types of Study Designs

  1. Observational Study: 
    - In this study design, values of the variable(s) of interest are recorded as they naturally occur 
    - There is NO interference by the researchers who conduct the study 
  
  2. Sample Survey 
    - A type of "Observational Study" where individuals report variables values themselves, frequently by giving their opinions 
  
  3. Experiment
    - In this study design, the researchers interfere, and they are the ones to assign the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals 
    - The researchers "take control" of the values of the explanatory variable because they want to see how changes in the value of the explanatory variable affect the response variable
