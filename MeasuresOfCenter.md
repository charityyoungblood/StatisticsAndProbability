<!-- Three Main Numerical Measures of Center: Mean, Median and Mode -->

1. Mean: the average of a set of observations 
  - When calculating "mean", remember to multiply the value by the frequency 
  - Example: 
  
  Below is the data from the last three World Cup soccer tournaments. A total of 192 games were played
  
  total # goals/game	frequency
          0	               17
          1	               45
          2	               51
          3	               37
          4	               25
          5	               11
          6	               3
          7	               2
          8	               1
    
    - Rather than add 192 numbers, we use the fact that the same numbers appear many times. For example, the number 0 appears 17 times, the number 1 appears 45 times, the number 2 appears 51 times, etc.
    -  The sum of the 192 numbers = 0(17) + 1(45) + 2(51) + 3(37) + 4(25) + 5(11) + 6(3) + 7(2) + 8(1) = 453
        453/192 = 2.359
    - This way of calculating a mean is sometimes referred to as a "weighted average", since each value is "weighted" by its frequency
    
2. Median: the midpoint in the distribution; It is the number such that half of the observations fall above, and half fall below
  - To calculate the median:
    - Order the data from smallest to largest 
    - Consider whether n (number of observations) is even or odd 
    - If "n" is even: the median M is the "mean" of the two center observations in the ordered list. These two observations are the ones "sitting" in the n / 2 and n / 2 + 1 spots in the ordered list
    - If "n" is odd: the median M is the "center" observation in the ordered list. This observation is the one "sitting" in the (n + 1) / 2 spot in the ordered list

3. Mode: the most commonly occurring value in a distribution 
  - When looking at the shape of a distribution, the mode is the value where the distribution has a "peak"
