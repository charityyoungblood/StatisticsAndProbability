<!-- Measures Of Spread: Standard Deviation --> 

1. Standard Deviation: 
  - A measure of spread that quantifies the spread of a distribution by measuring how FAR the observations are from their MEAN 
  - The Standard Deviation gives the average, or typical distance, between a data point and the mean
  - There are a few notations for the Standard Deviation including: SD, s, Sd, StDev
  - A LOW standard deviation means that MOST of the numbers are VERY CLOSE to the AVERAGE (MEAN)
  - A HIGH standard deviation means that the numbers are SPREAD OUT.

## Example: Here are the dress sizes tried on by customers in an 8 hour period: 
      
  Size 8, Size 10, Size 12, Size 14, Size 6, Size 4, Size 16, Size 10, Size 8, Size 14, Size 12 
  
    Step 1: Find the Mean of your data
    
      (8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 6 + 4 + 16 + 10 + 8 + 14 + 12) / 11 = 10.36
        
        Mean = 10.36
        
    Step 2: Find the deviations from the mean: the difference between each observation and the mean
      (8 - 11), (10 - 11), (12 - 11), (14 - 11), (6 - 11), (4 - 11), (16 - 11), (10 - 11), (8 - 11), (14 - 11), (12 - 11)
           -3, -1, 1, 3, -5, -7, 5, -1, -3, 3, 1
           
    Step 3: Square each of the deviations 
      (-3 * -3), (-1 * -1), (1 * 1), (3 * 3), (-5 * -5), (-7 * -7), (5 * 5), (-1 * -1), (-3 * -3), (3 * 3), (1 * 1) 
          
        9, 1, 1, 9, 25, 49, 25, 1, 9, 9, 1
        
    Step 4: Average the square deviations and divide by n - 1 (one less than the sample size)
        (9 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 25 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 1) / (11 - 1) = 13.9 
        ** This average of the squared deviations is called the "VARIANCE" of the data **
        
    Step 5: The SD of the data is the square root of the VARIANCE  
          SD = sqrt(13.9) = 3.73
          
    Step 6: Conclusion
        The SD (Standard Deviation) is 3.73, meaning that the actual dress size that is tried on each hour is 3.73 away from 10.36 (approximately 6.63 or Size 7)
          
2. The Standard Deviation should be PAIRED as a measure of spread with the MEAN as a measure of center 

3. The only way the Standard Deviation is "0" is if all observations have the same value, i.e. No Variability 

4. Standard Deviation is strongly influenced by outliers in the data 

5. Choosing Numerical Summaries:
  - Use the Mean, and the Standard Deviation as measure of center and spread ONLY for reasonably SYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTIONS with NO OUTLIERS 
  - Use Descriptive Statistics, i.e. Five Number Summary, for ALL OTHER CASES 
  
6. The Standard Deviation Rule (also known as The Empirical Rule)
  - For distributions having a symmetric mound-shape (this is known as a "normal" shape) the following rule applies: 
    - Approximately 68% of the observations fall within 1 Standard Deviation of the Mean
    - Approximately 95% of the observations fall within 2 Standard Deviations of the Mean.
    - Approximately 99.7% (or virtually ALL) of the observations fall within 3 Standard Deviations of the Mean.
