<!-- Intro To Statistics -->

Statistics is the process in which we collect data, summarize data and interpret data

Data Analysis encompasses four steps: 
  Step 1: Data Production/Producing Data
  Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Step 3: Probability 
  Step 4: Inference

These four steps are detailed below: 

## Step 1: Producing Data ## 

1. Population: 
  - The process of Statistics starts when we identify what group we want to study or learn something about 
  - This group is called the "Population" 
  - Population refers to more than "actual people"; also refers to animals, objects, etc. 

2. Sample:
  - A sample is a "subgroup" of the population 
  - When choosing a sample, we want to be sure the sample represents the population well
  - The process of choosing a sample and collecting data from it, is called "producing data" and it is Step 1 
  
3. Collect Data

## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis ##

1. In this step - after the data has been collected - we have to EXPLORE and make sense of the data
2. Summarizing the collected data is called "Exploratory Data Analysis"

## Step 3: Probability ## 

1. Since we want to be able to draw conclusions about the population, based on the sample results - we need to look at how the sample we're using may DIFFER from the population as a WHOLE - so we can factor that INTO our analysis
2. To examine the difference from the SAMPLE POPULATION and the WHOLE POPULATION we use "Probability" 
3. Probability is the "machinery" that allows us to draw conclusions about the population based on the data collected about the sample 

## Step 4: Inference ## 

1. In the last step - we use what we've discovered about our sample, to draw conclusions about our population
