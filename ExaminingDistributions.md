<!-- Examining Distributions - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) --> 

1. Since the data for each variable is a long list of values (whether qualitative or quantitative), is not very informative in "raw data" form 

2. To convert our "raw data" into useful information, we need to summarize and then examine the distribution of the categorical (qualitative) variable
  ## Distribution of a value refers to:
   ## WHAT values does the variable take 
   ## HOW often the variable takes those values 
  - The DISTRIBUTION of a categorical variable is summarized using:
    - Graphical display: pie chart, bar chart
    - Numerical summaries: the Graphical displays are supplemented by Numerical summaries, which are category counts and percentages 
    
3. Frequency Distributions 
  - In a "frequency distribution" we are looking at the "frequency" of certain categories 
  - For this example study, we asked 1200 women: Where do you carry the majority of your weight? Upper body, lower body, or balanced
  - The CATEGORICAL VARIABLE we are examining is "Body Type" 
  - These are our categories: upper body, lower body, balanced
  - From this data, we can create a "Frequency Distribution" table 
    - The table will consist of: 
      ## The different values (categories) the variable takes 
      ## How many times each value occurs (count)
      ## How often each value occurs (by converting count to percentage)
      
        Category	       Count	      Percent
        Balanced	        855	          855/1200 = 71.3%
        Upper Body	        235	          235/1200 = 19.6%
        Lower Body	        110	          110/1200 = 9.2%
        Total	           n=1200	       100%
        
## Pie Charts, Bar Charts and Pictograms are used to display QUALITATIVE DATA ##        

4. Pie and Bar Charts 
  - There are two simple graphical displays for visualizing the distribution of categorical data 
    - The Pie Chart: emphasizes how the different categories relate to the whole
    - The Bar Chart (displayed with a "count" or "percentage" axis): emphasizes how the different categories compare with each other 
    
5. Pictogram: a variation on pie charts and bar charts 
  - Pictograms CAN be misleading - make sure to use a critical approach when interpreting the information the Pictogram is trying to convey 
  
6. Describing Your Results: 
  - Once you have created your table, describe your results in "human speak" as follows for our "friends" dataset 
    - Describe the distribution of the variable "friends" in context:
      The students are NOT divided equally among the three categories. About 50% of the students find it as easy to make friends with the opposite sex as with the same sex. Among the remaining 50% of the students, the majority (36.2%) find it easier to make friends with people of the opposite sex, and the remainder (13.7%) find it easier to make friends with people of their own sex.
      
## Histogram, Stemplot and Boxplot are used to display QUANTITATIVE DATA ## 

7. To convert our "raw data" for our QUANTITATIVE variables into useful information, we need to summarize and then examine the distribution of the QUANTITATIVE variable 

8. Histogram: 
  - similar to a bar chart - a histogram is a way to display counts of data
  - Displays categorical variables in "bins" 
  - Histograms are used to display QUANTITATIVE variables 
  - To create a relative frequency table from Histogram data (Full Description in Stanford Stats Course - in One Quantitative Variable - Graps > Histogram: Intervals)
    - Calculate the total number of observations (total count) 
    - Calculate the relative frequency for each interval, by dividing the number of observations in each row by the total number of observations 
    
9. Calculating Missing Data 
  - It is possible to determine the number of scores (observation count) for an interval, if you have the total number of observations and the relative frequency for that interval 
  - For instance, if we know that we have 15 scores (or observations) and the relative frequency is 0.13, we can determine the number of scores by multiplying the total number of observations by the relative frequency and rounding up to the next whole number: 15 * 0.13 = 1.95, which rounds up to 2 observations.
