<!-- Examining Distributions - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) --> 

1. Since the data for each variable is a long list of values (whether qualitative or quantitative), is not very informative in "raw data" form 

2. To convert our "raw data" into useful information, we need to summarize and then examine the distribution of the variable
  ## Distribution of a value refers to:
   ## WHAT values does the variable take 
   ## HOW often the variable takes those values 
   
3. Frequency Distributions 
  - In a "frequency distribution" we are looking at the "frequency" of certain categories 
  - For this example study, we asked 1200 women: Where do you carry the majority of your weight? Upper body, lower body, or balanced
  - The CATEGORICAL VARIABLE we are examining is "Body Type" 
  - These are our categories: upper body, lower body, balanced
  - From this data, we can create a "Frequency Distribution" table 
    - The table will consist of: 
      ## The different values (categories) the variable takes 
      ## How many times each value occurs (count)
      ## How often each value occurs (by converting count to percentage)
      
        Category	       Count	      Percent
        Balanced	        855	          855/1200 = 71.3%
        Upper Body	        235	          235/1200 = 19.6%
        Lower Body	        110	          110/1200 = 9.2%
        Total	           n=1200	       100%
        
4. Pie and Bar Charts 
  - There are two simple graphical displays for visualizing the distribution of categorical data 
    - The Pie Chart: emphasizes how the different categories relate to the whole
    - The Bar Chart (displayed with a "count" or "percentage" axis): emphasizes how the different categories compare with each other
