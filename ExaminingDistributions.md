<!-- Examining Distributions - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) --> 

1. Since the data for each variable is a long list of values (whether qualitative or quantitative), is not very informative in "raw data" form 

2. To convert our "raw data" into useful information, we need to summarize and then examine the distribution of the variable
  ## Distribution of a value refers to:
   ## WHAT values does the variable take 
   ## HOW often the variable takes those values 
   
3. Frequency Distributions 
  - In a "frequency distribution" we are looking at the "frequency" of certain categories 
  - For this example study, we asked 1200 women: Where do you carry the majority of your weight? Upper body, lower body, middle or balanced
  - The CATEGORICAL VARIABLE we are examining is "Body Type" 
  - These are our categories: upper body, lower body, middle, balanced
  - From this data, we can create a "Frequency Distribution" table 
    - The table will consist of: 
      ## The different values (categories) the variable takes 
      ## How many times each value occurs (count)
      ## How often each value occurs (by converting count to percentage)
      
        Category	  Count	   Percent
        About right	   855	  
        Overweight	235	
        Underweight	110	
        Total	n=1200	100%
