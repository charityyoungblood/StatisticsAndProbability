<!-- Exploratory Data Analysis --> 

The purpose of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to convert the available data from their raw form to an informative one, in which the main features of the data are illuminated

1. What do we mean by "data"?
  - Data: pieces of information about individuals organized into variables 
  - Individuals: refers to the "subject", "person" or "objects" being studied 
  - Variables: A particular characteristic of the individual 
    ## Categorical Variable: these are variables that take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups (Ex: race, gender, smoker)
    ## Categorical Variables are also called "qualitative variables" 
    
## ## Quantitative Variable: these are variables that take numerical values and represent some kind of measurement - think of "quantity" (Ex: Age, Weight, Height)
  
2. Dataset 
  - set of data identified with particular circumstances
  - Datasets are typically displayed in tables  
    - Rows: represent "individuals"
    - Columns: represent "variables" 
    
3. When examining the relationship between two variables, the FIRST STEP is to classify the two relevant variables according to their role and type 
   - Case C -> Q: Categorical Explanatory/Independent Variable(s) and Quantitative Response/Dependent Variable 
      - Here we compare the DISTRIBUTIONS of the Quantitative Response Variable for EACH CATEGORY of the Explanatory Variable 
      - Graphical Display Used: Side-By-Side Boxplots 
      - Nummerical Summaries Used: Descriptive Statistics of the RESPONSE variable for EACH value (Category) of the Explanatory Variable separately 
    
  - Case C -> C: Categorical Explanatory/Independent Variable(s) and Categorical Response/Dependent Variable
