<!-- Scatterplot --> 

1. Scatterplot
  - To examine the relationship between two QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES we use a Scatterplot
  - To create a Scatterplot:
    -> Each PAIR of values is plotted > The EXPLANATORY VARIABLE (X) is plotted on the X-Axis (Horizontal)
    -> The value of the RESPONSE VARIABLE (Y) is plotted on the Y-Axis 
  - When creating a Scatterplot the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE should ALWAYS be plotted on the HORIZONTAL AXIS
  - The RESPONSE VARIABLE should ALWAYS be plotted on the VERTICAL AXIS 
  
2. How To Interpret A Scatterplot 
  - When describing the relationship between two quantitative variables using a Scatterplot we look at: 
    - Overall Pattern:
      - Direction: this can be "Positive", "Negative" or "Neither" 
        - Positive Relationship: means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with an increase in the other 
        - Negative Relationship: means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with a decrease in the other 
      - Form 
      - Strength 
    - Deviations From The Pattern:
