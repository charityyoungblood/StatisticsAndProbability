<!-- Scatterplot --> 

1. Scatterplot
  - To examine the relationship between two QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES we use a Scatterplot
  - To create a Scatterplot:
    -> Each PAIR of values is plotted > The EXPLANATORY VARIABLE (X) is plotted on the X-Axis (Horizontal)
    -> The value of the RESPONSE VARIABLE (Y) is plotted on the Y-Axis 
  - When creating a Scatterplot the EXPLANATORY VARIABLE should ALWAYS be plotted on the HORIZONTAL AXIS
  - The RESPONSE VARIABLE should ALWAYS be plotted on the VERTICAL AXIS
