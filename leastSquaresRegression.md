<!-- Least Squares Regression -->

##  In the special case of linear relationship, use the least squares regression line as a summary of the overall pattern, and use it to make predictions ##

1. Regression
  - The technique that specifies the dependence of the response variable on the explanatory variable is called "Regression"
  - When that dependence is "Linear" the technique is called "Linear Regression" 
  - Linear Regression finds the line that BEST FITS the pattern of the linear relationship, or in other words, the line that BEST describes HOW the response variable linearly DEPENDS on the explanatory variable

2. Least Squares Criterion
  - This criterion is set to choose the line that has the smallest sum of squared vertical deviations 
  - See Stanford Statistics: Case Q -> Q Under "Least Squares Regression"
