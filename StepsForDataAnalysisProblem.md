<!-- Steps for Data Analysis Problems --> 

## Step 1: Understand The Problem ## 
  - Before we begin to look at specific questions, we EXAMINE some general features of the problem including:
  
    - How was the Data collected?
    - What is the Data Structure?  
    - What is the Overall Study Design? 
    - What are the Variables in the study? 
    - What TYPE of Variables are they? 
    - What QUESTIONS are we trying to answer with the Data provided? 
      - Example Question: What are the drinking habits of students at this university? In particular, what is the typical number of drinks a student has during a week? Do the data suggest that drinking is a problem in this university?
  
  - View your Data set and examine the following: 
    - What information is in the data?
    - How is it formatted?
    - Is it formatted correctly? 
    
## Step 2: Reflect on The Question ## 
  - We need to think about the question and use our intuition and/or experience to try and PREDICT what the data will show 
  - Write it down/save, as you'll come back to this prediction after the actual data analysis and compare your prediction with the actual results
  
## Step 3: Analyze Data ## 
  - In this step we choose and conduct analyses that are needed in order to address the current question 
  *** Plan Analyses*** 
      - Before choosing the appropriate analyses it is important to:
        - IDENTIFY the RELEVANT variables
        - CLASSIFY the RELEVANT variables 
  *** Exploratory Analyses *** 
      - Now that we have identified and classified the relevant variables, we use Exploratory Data Analysis methods to help us make important features of the data visible 
      - REMEMBER: Exploratory Data Analysis is Step 2 of our Statistical process 
      - First, select the most MEANINGFUL graphical display 
      - Next, Use the Statistical program of your choice (RStudio in your case), to construct the chosen graphical display
      - Report Results: To report your results, use the following: 
        - Describe the key features of the display and by support your description with numerical measures
      
## Step 4: Draw Conclusions ## 
  - In this step, we interpret the results we got from our analysis in the context of the current question 
  - Consider what the results mean 
  - Reflect on conclusions
