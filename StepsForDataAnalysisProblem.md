<!-- Steps for Data Analysis Problems --> 

## Step 1: Understand The Problem ## 
  - Before we begin to look at specific questions, we EXAMINE some general features of the problem including:
  
    - How was the Data collected?
    - What is the Data Structure?  
    - What is the Overall Study Design? 
    - What are the Variables in the study? 
    - What TYPE of Variables are they? 
    - What QUESTIONS are we trying to answer with the Data provided? 
      - Example Question: What are the drinking habits of students at this university? In particular, what is the typical number of drinks a student has during a week? Do the data suggest that drinking is a problem in this university?
  
  - View your Data set and examine the following: 
    - What information is in the data?
    - How is it formatted?
    - Is it formatted correctly? 
    
## Step 2: Reflect on The Question ## 
  - We need to think about the question and use our intuition and/or experience to try and PREDICT what the data will show 
  - Write it down/save, as you'll come back to this prediction after the actual data analysis and compare your prediction with the actual results
